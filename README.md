# ProjectTimeAversion
A Reverse-Metroidvania about accepting the inevitable

# Artist Statement
This project is a simple project to looks to tell a story about accepting the ineviable march of time and to accept that you're getting old, that you'll lose things
you'll take for granted. This little game starts of as a simple platformer, gaining abilites that will help you traverse the world, however, as you progress, you'll 
lose those abilites due to time that is sped up around you. Your mission is to save your hibernating crew from a time field that unnaturally speeds up time and it gets worse as you close in to your goal.
Eventually, you'll be so old that you're literally marching to your inevitable death, to save the next generation from experiencing your terrible fate. 

This project was inspired by my own experience and observations of my family and other into how aging has affected us. I've observed how we've gotten slower, more tired, and sometimes even
more forgetful. There are also age related ailments, such as worsening vision and, in the case of the older members of our families, more difficulty in walking without assistance.
It can be frustrating, having something that you used to do easily being more difficult or pratically impossible due to aging. I want people to experience that frustration with this project,
to know that things like this are inevitable and to accept it. The small narrative that this little game presents the player is to help you accept your limitations
and find alternative ways to accomplish your tasks, just like those around us do when faced with adversity.
