# ProjectTimeAversion
A Reverse-Metroidvania about accepting the inevitable

# Description

This project is a simple project to looks to tell a story about accepting the inevitable march of time and to accept that you're getting old, that you'll lose things you'll take for granted. This little game starts of as a simple platformer, gaining abilities that will help you traverse the world, however, as you progress, you'll lose those abilities due to time that is sped up around you. Your mission is to save your hibernating crew from a time field that unnaturally speeds up time and it gets worse as you close in to your goal. Eventually, you'll be so old that you're literally marching to your inevitable death, to save the next generation from experiencing your terrible fate.

# Artist Statement

This project was inspired by my own experience and observations of my family and other into how aging has affected us. I've observed how we've gotten slower, more tired, and sometimes even more forgetful. There are also age related ailments, such as worsening vision and, in the case of the older members of our families, more difficulty in walking without assistance. It can be frustrating, having something that you used to do easily being more difficult or practically impossible due to aging. I want people to experience that frustration with this project, to know that things like this are inevitable and to accept it. That things get harder and to make adjustments through the tough times. The small narrative that this little game presents the player is to help you accept your limitations and use alternative means to accomplish your tasks, just like those around us do when faced with adversity.

Facing challenges is a part of life, so I wanted to challenge myself with using an engine I was unfamiliar with. While I've been using Unity and Unreal for a while, I decided to take what I knew and decided to use the Godot Engine. Taking time to learn and using that experience to get better was something I used while making this game. Itâ€™s not prefect but nothing you do in life never is and you should enjoy what time you have playing this game like I did while making it, even if it get frustrating to do so because the best things in life are the some of the hardest.
